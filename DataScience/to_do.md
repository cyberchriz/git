## Here's a list of things that shouldn't be missing in a good statistics toolbox; Some of this is already implemented, the rest is a list of ideas for future work in order to make this library more complete.

Basic statistical operations: Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard deviation, Skewness, Kurtosis, Covariance, Correlation, Histogram

Data preprocessing functions: Scaling, Normalization, Binning, Missing Value Imputation, Outlier Detection and Treatment, Data Encoding (One-hot encoding, Label encoding)

Data Transformation functions: PCA, t-SNE, LLE, NMF, ICA, MDS, Kernel PCA

Regression Analysis: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet Regression, Logistic Regression

Time Series Analysis: Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Seasonal Decomposition, Prophet

Hypothesis Testing: T-tests, Chi-Square tests, ANOVA, MANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, Mann-Whitney U test

Clustering: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering

Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

Statistical Modeling: Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines

Probability Distributions: Normal Distribution, Binomial Distribution, Poisson Distribution, Exponential Distribution, Chi-Square Distribution, F-Distribution, Student's T-Distribution
