## Heap Allocation Logger
dependencies: `<iostream>`, `<boost/stacktrace.hpp>`;

usage:
1. First(!) set a preprocessor flag `#define MEMLOG`
2. Then `#include <memlog.h>`, alternatively include as part of the `<utilities.h>` library.
This will overide the `new` and `delete` keywords: anytime memory is allocated or deallocated
on the heap, this will be logged to the console (bytes, calling function, total bytes).
3. The order above matters, because `<memlog.h>`will only compile (thus take effect) if the `MEMLOG` flag has been defined beforehand. The benefit is that the logging can easily be disabled by simply commenting out the `MEMLOG` define statement.
