## Timer
dependencies: `<chrono>`, `<iostream>`;

usage:
1. 
    `#include <timer.h>`, alternatively include as part of `<utilities.h>`
2. 
    either create an instance of `Timer`, then use any of the methods
        - `Timer::elapsed_sec()`
        - `Timer::elapsed_millisec()`
        - `Timer::elapsed_microsec()`
    on this instance of `Timer`
    
    or set the flag `#define TIMELOG` as a preprocessor directive, then use the macro `TIMER` anywhere in the code start a timer; this will print the timer's lifetime on the console as soon as the timer goes out out of scope, i.e. when the function it lives in ends; commenting out the `#define TIMELOG` flag in this case will stop the logging; the `TIMER` macros in this case won't be compiled and therefore have no performance impact
