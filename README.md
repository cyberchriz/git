THIS REPOSITORY IS 'WORK IN PROGRESS'. MOST OF THE CODE WILL WORK WITHOUT ANY ISSUES, BUT I'LL BE CONSTANTLY IMPROVING IT AND ADDING TO IT. YOU MAY STILL FEEL FREE TO USE IT AS IT IS, BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT NOTHING's PERFECT.
I'M SELF-TAUGHT AND NOT A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER.
THIS REPOSITORY IS PUBLIC FOR A REASON - COLLABORATION, IMPLEMENTATION IN YOUR OWN CODE, CRITIQUE AND SUGGESTIONS ARE WELCOME.
